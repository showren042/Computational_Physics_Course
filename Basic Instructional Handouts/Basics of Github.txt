Using GitHub to manage your own code is good practice for you.  Uploading the code from your homework and exams is worth 5% of your grade (checked only once, after the final exam is turned in).   Here are a few tips for how to use Github.  


To create a new git directory, in new directory:
git init

Create a completely blank repository at github.com.  
git remote add origin *UrlFromGithub*

do some work.  To check on changes made
git status

If that work is complete, you need to add changes to the commit
git add *newfile1*
git add *newfile2*
...

If you're sure they are functional, you need to commit the changes
git commit -m " *summary message* "

You need to update the server:
git push -u origin master

If you delete or rename a file (on purpose), you can remove it from the local repository via 
git rm *filename*

To download new files added to a directory from a GitHub url:
git pull
