Hello Professor,
We had a discussion during office hours (09/25/2020) for problem 2(b) about how matlab fails 
to hold two or more loglog curves on the same plot. That's why we decided that i'd upload the 
corrected graph with necessary changes been made. 

this is causing me to turn the homework in late.

upon your instruction, this is a friendly reminder so that the delayed submission doesn't lead to 
a cut in marks.

Thank you for your time and considerations.

regards,
showren
